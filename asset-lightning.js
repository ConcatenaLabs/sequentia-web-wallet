// AN ASSET TO ANOTHER OPERATOR'S WALLET, OVER LIGHTNING: the rule that decides, in default mode,
// whether a payment of a Sequentia asset to a receive code goes over Lightning between operators
// or to the code's address on the chain. It is Bitcoin's rule for BTC, in a reference currency:
//
//   1. The code's `sequentia` part names the payer's own operator: paid in the tree (default-arca.js).
//   2. The code carries an invoice in the asset (`lightning=`, an invoice of the receiver's operator
//      for a Lightning receive into its tree) for exactly the amount sent, and the payment is worth
//      no more than the limit in USD (`lightningLimitUsd`), and the payer's operator can carry it
//      (its node in the asset up, as much spendable as the amount), and the invoice's final lock
//      fits what the operator lets its node lock a payment for, with room for a hop on the way: paid over
//      Lightning, out of the tree, through the payer's operator's node to the receiver's.
//   3. Anything else: the code's address, and the review says why in one sentence.
//
// The limit is in USD, never in units of the asset: one unit of GOLD is worth thousands of USDX.
// The page sets it (window.SEQ_ASSET_LN_MAX_USD: a number of USD, or null for none); the default
// is DEFAULT_LIMIT_USD. An asset the price feed does not value cannot be held to it, so it goes to
// the address. A payment that goes over Lightning and fails comes back to the payer as a leaf of
// its own (the leaf library takes its htlc leaf back), and the review then offers the address.
//
// Every amount, fee and refusal of the payment itself is the leaf library's (`lightning_pay_quote`,
// `lightning_pay`): this module only names the route, from the invoice, the price and the
// operator's published information. It has no DOM, so it runs under Node (asset-lightning.test.mjs).
// Ambra mobile (app/lib/src/data/) and the browser extension route receive codes in their own code:
// give them the same rule.
