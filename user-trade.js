// The user-mode composer's engine: one market trade, in one native step.
//
// The person names what they pay, what they get and how much they pay. The engine reads the
// single-step book (tooling/lsp/single-step-book.mjs), asks the wallet's leaf library to price
// each candidate it can fill, picks one (the most received, then the fewest parties), and makes
// the ticket: amount in, amount out, one cost line. On confirm it settles that one candidate the
// way the settlement router names (tooling/lsp/settlement-router.mjs planSingleStep), and follows
// it to "Settled", or to "Returned" when nothing traded. It never falls back to another source.
//
// Every amount on a ticket is the leaf library's answer (swap_read, take_quote, settle_quote);
// this file compares the library's numbers and adds the ones it shows, and decides nothing the
// library decides. It has no DOM and no node: import, so the page (user-composer.js) and the
// drill (tooling/user-mode-drill.mjs) run the same code.
