// DEFAULT MODE ON THE OPERATOR'S TREE: what the wallet decides by itself, so that a person in
// default mode never takes a step, sees a choice or reads a word of how value moves.
//
// The page names one operator (window.SEQ_ARCA: its server, the node the leaf wallet follows the
// chain through, and the operator's key, pinned). In default mode a wallet that has not joined
// one joins that operator by itself, once its server shows the pinned key; a phrase restored here
// finds the coins it holds there. Coins then live in the tree by default:
//
//   - Receiving gives a receive code (the leaf library's single-use receive request), which the
//     faucet and another wallet of the same operator pay into the tree; coins that land at the
//     wallet's address on the chain are boarded by themselves, shown as arriving until the board
//     is final.
//   - Sending to a receive code of the same operator and chain pays it in the tree, in seconds;
//     anything else (an address, an invoice, an account id) goes the way it always went.
//   - Where the tree cannot do what was asked, the old way is taken; where neither can, the
//     refusal says so in plain words and nothing is signed.
//
// Nothing here computes a leaf, a fee or a verdict about a coin: those are the library's. This
// module reads its answers (balance, info) and names the route. It has no DOM, so it runs under
// Node (default-arca.test.mjs).

// The words default mode shows for all of this. None is in user-trade.js's
// USER_MODE_FORBIDDEN_WORDS (default-arca.test.mjs checks it). They are the kit's default-mode
// contract (docs/DEFAULT_MODE.md), the same in every Concatena wallet: change it there first.
