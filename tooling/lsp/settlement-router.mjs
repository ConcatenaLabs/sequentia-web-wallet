// Settlement router — the rail-agnostic matching principle, made concrete.
//
// PRINCIPLE (Andreas, 2026-07-16): the DEX matches on {asset, price, size, side} ALONE.
// Rails (Lightning vs on-chain) are NOT a matching axis — they are a settlement preference
// each party states for the side it holds. This module takes a MATCH that already happened
// (rail-blind) and decides HOW to settle it, inserting an LSP bridge ONLY where the two
// sides' rail choices genuinely cross. When they coincide, the LSP is not in the value path
// at all (it only did matchmaking). See memory dex-rail-agnostic-matching.
//
// A BTC<->asset swap has exactly two legs, atomically bound by ONE preimage H:
//   • BTC leg:   payer = BUYER  (pays BTC),   receiver = SELLER (receives BTC)
//   • asset leg: payer = SELLER (pays asset), receiver = BUYER  (receives asset)
// Each leg's two endpoints each have a rail. Per leg:
//   • endpoints AGREE            -> settle natively on that rail (no bridge)
//   • endpoints DISAGREE (cross) -> the LSP terminates the LN end and originates the
//                                   on-chain end, passing H through: one submarine hop,
//                                   on THAT leg only.
// A receiver on 'ln' with no inbound liquidity needs a JIT channel first (provisionInbound).
//
// This file is a PURE function: no I/O, no config, no fund movement. It is the spine the
// live settlement path (runMixed / the cross-book couriers / pure-LN) will be refactored to
// obey, and it is exhaustively unit-tested in settlement-router.test.mjs.

/** @typedef {'ln'|'chain'|'leaf'} Rail */

// THE LEAF RAIL. A leaf is a coin in an operator's tree (developer mode's leaves). It settles in
// one of two ways, and never through the LSP or a preimage:
//   • IN THE TREE: both parties hold leaves on both legs. One reassignment both wallets sign
//     (offer, accept, complete) moves both assets at once: method 'in-tree'.
//   • IN A ROUND: one party holds leaves on both legs and the other is an ordinary on-chain
//     covenant order. The operator's round spends the order, pays its maker on the chain and
//     gives the taker a leaf: method 'round' (a take from leaves).
// Every other shape with a leaf has no construction, and is refused rather than planned: a leaf
// against Lightning needs the operator's gateway, which the composer does not run, and a party
// with a leaf on one leg and the chain on the other is no trade either side can sign. BTC is
// never a leaf: native bitcoin lives on its own chain, so a BTC leg stays on Lightning or an
// on-chain hash-lock, and a pair with BTC in it has no leaf rail at all.
